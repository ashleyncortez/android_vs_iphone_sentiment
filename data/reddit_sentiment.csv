"Signal Private Messenger team here, we support an app used by everyone from Elon to the Hong Kong protestors to our Grandpa’s weekly group chat, AMA!","Hi everyone,

We are currently having a record level of downloads for the Signal app around the world. Between WhatsApp announcing they would be sharing everything with the Facebook mothership and the Apple privacy labels that allowed people to compare us to other popular messengers, it seems like many people are interested in private communication. 

Some quick facts about us: we are an open-sourced nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring private and secure communication to anyone and everyone. One of the reasons we opted for organizing as a nonprofit is that it aligned with our want to create a business model for a technology that wasn’t predicated on the need for personal data in any way. 

As an organization we work very hard to not know anything about you all. There aren’t analytics in the app, we use end to end encryption for everything from your messages and calls/video as well as all your metadata so we have no idea who you talk to or what you talk about.

We are very excited for all the interest and support, but are even more excited to hear from you all. 

We are online now and answering questions for at least the next 3 hours (in between a whole bunch of work stuff). If you are coming to this outside of the time-window don't worry please still leave a question, we will come back on Monday to answer more. 

-Jun

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the questions and comments, we always learn a tremendous amount and value the feedback greatly. We are going to go back to work now but will continue to monitor and check in periodically and then will do another pass on Monday.",5216,0.9725,Android

TeamViewer has been hacked. They are denying everything and pointing fingers at the users.,"TeamViewer has yet to leave a comment ~~on the issue~~ that's not in complete denial of the problem.  

Update: /u/TeamViewerOfficial has reached out.  Posted [here in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4m7ay6/teamviewer_has_been_hacked_they_are_denying/d3ufp8e), and sent a PM with [this post here in /r/technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4md95j/teamviewer_launches_trusted_devices_and_data/) ([and one at /r/teamviewer](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4mcvp4/teamviewer_launches_trusted_devices_and_data/)). They also [announced an open letter to users](https://twitter.com/TeamViewer/status/738725855959101440) on Twitter ([archived here](http://archive.is/jED6k)). Link to the open letter [here](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/company/press/teamviewer-launches-trusted-devices-and-data-integrity/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=social%20&utm_content=trusteddevices/dataintegrity&utm_campaign=Social) ([archived here](http://archive.is/Githe)). Right now it looks like they are trying to mitigate the problem with a band-aid, excuses and new features.  

**Update 2016-06-06 (10th):** Got this in a PM from a user:    
>They just admitted the basis for their assumption of password reuse. If your email address comes up on haveibeenpwned, they simply and blindly assume that you reuse passwords and that is the only possible reason your account is compromised.  
[In reply to a /r/teamviewer comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4mq9a5/badly_worded_sentence_or_can_teamviewer_see_our/d3xu3gc) they seem to be admitting this.  

Right now, we still don't know how the unknown party have accessed the clients, even though it's been 4 days since the creation of this post.  
*****

Users are reporting breaches, and thousands of dollars have been stolen with the client, all over /r/teamviewer and at their [support Twitter account](https://twitter.com/TeamViewer_help/with_replies). TV is blaming users with reusing passwords, [yet users with 2FA](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4m4a5n/psa_2factorauthentication_use_it/d3snp7k) and [unique very long generated passwords](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4jr9qn/hacked_trough_teamviewer_1800_spent_on_paypal/d3a5tcf) were hacked.  

Some also suggest that [their DNS servers were hijacked and the clients believed the fake server](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4m3izy/teamviewer_dns_issues/), being the method of the attack.  

One of the main problems are that they are not taking responsibility: (quoted from /u/rich-uk)  
>Teamviewer is being used as a vector of attack. This has happened on other sites where they had no critical information and within 48 hours everyone's logged in sessions were logged out, an email went round saying you had to click the link in the email (to verify ownership) and set up two factor auth as they knew they were being targeted.
Teamviewer must know they are being targeted, and the stakes are high as the software allows complete access to a trusted machine - it's basically a master key - and there hasn't been a single response with teeth from teamviewer.

Some info by /u/re1jo on the auth protocol [here shows that no password or 2FA would protect your machines](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4m7ay6/teamviewer_has_been_hacked_they_are_denying/d3ucnxk) (based on TV7, may have changed in never versions).  
/u/swatspyder also [found out that](https://www.reddit.com/r/teamviewer/comments/4mbx7h/my_theory_on_the_teamviewer_contact_requests_that/) The TV Management Console page had a flaw that leaked users' names and their existences, may be fixed now. Also:  
>TeamViewer has only stated that the DDoS attack on their DNS infrastructure is unrelated to concerns about their user database being hacked: [Statement on Service Outage](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/company/press/statement-on-service-outage/)
They have NOT specifically denied that their user database has been compromised.
